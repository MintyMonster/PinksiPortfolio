# PinksiPortfolio
This website is a portfolio for an illustration student at the University of Gloucestershire. It shows all of her work, and assignments in a very visual based experience. The website is still currently under production however we are looking to add a database for all the images and an admin panel for easy access andd image upload.

# How to view
The portfolio is not currently live, however will be in the coming future.
